# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

## Problem Statement
The goal is to explore relationships between factors such as date, temperature, humidity, and categorical variables like seasons and holidays. The objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts rented bike counts. This predictive model can aid in optimizing service planning, resource allocation, and enhancing user experience for the bike-sharing service.

## Features and Selection
The selected features crucial for predicting bike-sharing demand are:

Hour

Temperature(Â°C)

Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)

Feature ranking indicates the importance of each feature in the prediction model. Notably, 'Hour,' 'Rainfall(mm),' 'Snowfall (cm),' 'Holiday,' and 'Functioning Day' were identified as the most influential features.

## Machine Learning Models
The project involved implementing three machine learning models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regression

Gradient Boosting Regression

Each model's performance was evaluated using key metrics such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared Score.

## Conclusion
The successful completion of this project demonstrates proficiency in various data science techniques, from exploratory data analysis to machine learning model implementation. The insights gained contribute to the broader goal of optimizing bike-sharing services for improved resource management and user experience.
